- **Medallion architecture** in Microsoft Fabric organizes data into Bronze (raw), Silver (validated), and Gold (enriched) layers, improving data quality and enabling structured analytics workflows using tools like Dataflows, Notebooks, and Pipelines.  
- **Querying and reporting** are streamlined through the SQL analytics endpoint and Power BI's Direct Lake mode, allowing real-time data exploration, modeling, and tailored reporting for different audiences.  
- **Lakehouse management** emphasizes security through granular permissions, efficient CI/CD integration with Git, and best practices for data governance, ensuring high data quality and seamless collaboration across teams.
