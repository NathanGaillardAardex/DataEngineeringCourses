## 5. [Use real-time eventstreams in Microsoft Fabric](./5-eventstreams.md)
- **Microsoft Fabric Eventstreams** enables no-code, real-time event capturing and processing with drag-and-drop pipelines, supporting multiple sources (e.g., Azure Event Hubs, IoT Hub) and scalable ETL operations.  
- **Eventstream components** include sources (e.g., databases, messaging systems), transformations (e.g., filtering, aggregation, windowing), and destinations (e.g., eventhouses, lakehouses) for flexible data routing and processing.  
- **Advanced features** like windowing functions, complex transformations, and multi-destination routing allow for sophisticated data analysis and real-time actions within a fully managed environment.

## 6. [Work with real-time data in a Microsoft Fabric eventhouse](./6-eventhouse.md)
- **Eventhouse in Microsoft Fabric** enables real-time data management using KQL databases, supporting data ingestion from static and streaming sources, with robust querying via KQL and SQL, and integrated visualization tools like KQL Querysets and Copilot.  
- **Optimizing KQL queries** involves filtering columns and rows, using time-based filters, and summarizing data to handle large real-time datasets efficiently, improving query performance and resource usage.  
- **Advanced features** like materialized views and stored functions allow for reusable queries, pre-aggregated data storage, and streamlined data analysis, enhancing the efficiency and maintainability of real-time data workflows.
